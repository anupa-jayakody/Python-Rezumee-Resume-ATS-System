Use case
- In the competitive job market, job seekers are often challenged with to find the jobs that they are best matched to apply. It is a known fact that application tracking systems are in place for initial screening of the employees from the employer's end. 

What is an application tracking system otherwise known as an ATS system??

- It is a tool used to compare how well is the applicant matching with the skills listed in the job advert. Applicant's are advised to use such a tool to guage how well you are positioned to apply for the job and also employers use such tools. 

My project simply is an ATS system performing below tasks

- Compare the applicant's resume and the job advert skills and show the similarity between the two
- Hilight the skills/keywords present in the applicant's resume that are listed in the job advert
- Hilight the missing skills

Next steps

-Develop a commercial application which can be used by potential job seekers and employers.
