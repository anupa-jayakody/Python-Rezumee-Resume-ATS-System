Use case

- In the competitive job market, job seekers are often challenged to find the jobs that they are best matched to apply. It is a known fact that application tracking systems are in place for the initial screening of the employees from the employer's end. 

What is an application tracking system otherwise known as an ATS system??

- It is a tool used to compare how well the applicant matches with the skills listed in the job advert. Applicants are advised to use such a tool to gauge how well they are positioned to apply for the job and employers also use such tools. 

My project simply is an ATS system performing the below tasks

- Compare the applicant's resume and the job advert skills and show the similarity between the two
- Highlight the skills/keywords present in the applicant's resume that are listed in the job advert
- Highlight the missing skills

Next steps

- Develop a commercial application which can be used by potential job seekers and employers.
